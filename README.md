This repository contains my coursework and projects for sections 0-7 and 9 (TypeScript) of the Full Stack Open course. Full Stack Open is a comprehensive web development course covering both the front-end and back-end, using technologies like **React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express and TypeScript**.

## Overview

The Full Stack Open course has provided me with valuable insights and hands-on experience in full-stack web development. I've completed sections 0-7, which cover front-end development with React, back-end development with Node.js, RESTful APIs, databases, and authentication.
